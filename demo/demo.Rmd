```{r setup}
library(feasiblesads)
```

This package is functions & infrastructure to sample the feasible set for a SAD given S and N.

For now it is used by various projects in RMD's other repos. 

The `time-capsule` branch preserves the state of the repo for `diazrenata/conditionalsads`. Future work will be based on `master`. 

For `S = 20` and `N = 100`...


```{r sample a fs}
fs_sample <- sample_fs(s = 20, n = 100, nsamples = 1000, storeyn = TRUE, storepath = here::here("demo", "working-dir"))

head(fs_sample)

fs_sample_tally <- tally_sets(fs_sample)

head(fs_sample_tally)

```

Central tendency following Locey & White...
```{r get ct}
fs_ct <- find_ct(fs_sample)

fs_ct
```
